Team Jaeger's Educational HAM Radio Simulator
**VERSION 1.0 RELEASE NOTES**

You can find a formal presentation deck [here]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qlr9JiHjSdjncG1B0CscVDeXN3O9HE6Q/view?usp=sharing))!

We are excited to introduce the very first version of our HAM Radio Simulator. The simulator brings to you 3 different modes: 
- Server-client Networking Communiication: Users connecting to the same server would be able to communicate with each other using CW code in real time. We also printed everything sent from the server onto the screen so that people can catch up with the conversation. In our next release, we would introduce the English translator integrated into the conversation
- Scenario Mode: with scripted scenarios, AI-built scenario, and self-customed scenario. However, due to the nature of using multithreading on Java and JavaFX, switching between modes at a time might cause the program to function inaccurately. For example, when you are listening to a CW conversation and switch the modes without finishing it, the conversation might be played overlapped even if you are in a different mode.
- Basic Training Mode: We are working hard on this training mode to provide more valuable lessons of different level to users.

We hope you have time to try out our new application. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us through hoangtrieuhuynh22@augustana.edu and/or nhatminhphan23@augustana.edu and/or hieunguyen23@augustana.edu. Thank you!
