In this intense 10-minute mission, your goal is to rescue as many civilians as possible, each one in need of urgent help. Your task is to achieve the highest score within the time limit, and your performance will be recorded on the ranking board for everyone to see.&#10;&#10;As the game begins, you'll need to start by adjusting your filter and tuning into different frequencies. Each specific frequency brings you in contact with a civilian awaiting assistance. These civilians will each have a unique need – they may either require you to transmit critical information to a rescue team or receive a CW (Continuous Wave) code that they’re sending your way. Precision and speed are essential here; you'll need to understand the code or relay the information accurately to succeed in your mission.&#10;&#10;Your score varies depending on the level of difficulty associated with each civilian you encounter. Rescuing a Level 0 civilian earns you 1 point, while a Level 1 rescue grants you 2 points. The most challenging rescues, at Level 2, reward you with 3 points. Every point counts, so aim high and prioritize efficiently to maximize your score.&#10;&#10;Keep focused, work fast, and rise to the challenge. Your results and ranking await at the end of each session." wrapText="true" />
